    <p>
I have been working with GoodData since 2010. I started there as a research engineer on the new analytical query engine project. In short time I became “MAQL master”, helping customers creating and debugging their reports and metrics. Together with my colleagues we have developed dozens of best practices, tricks and work-arounds to satisfy our customer needs. Debugging MAQL metrics and reports has became my passion.
